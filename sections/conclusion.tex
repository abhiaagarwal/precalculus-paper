\section{Conclusion}

Trigonometry is weird.
Just by observing triangles and the ratios they create, 12 fundamental functions were made.
They have applications in everything; I’m pretty sure that every building in the entire world was made with engineers using these functions.
If not, I pray for the souls inside those buildings.
Now, I know that god created the functions in a drunken stupor; but, he didn’t do a terrible job.
After all, he is all power and wise. Trigonometry has fundamental applications in just about everything.
The graphs? I have no idea, probably calculus or something.
Engineers seem to love that.
Well, I know that I have Wolfram Alpha whenever I need it.
This project took more time than I expected, almost three days worth of work (and learning LaTeX), however I’m glad I didn’t do it the night before like half the people in our class inevitably will.
And with this, I tell my sophomore friends about how they’re lucky they probably won’t have to do it next year; but, I also tell them how misfortunate they are as they won't do this next year.

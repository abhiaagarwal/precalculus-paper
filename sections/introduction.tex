\section{Introduction}

It is widely accepted that god created the earth in six days. Although the details have been lost to the infinite reaches of time, recent discoveries have found that it actually took eight days. On the seventh day, god, with his infinite wisdom, created mathematics. He created algebra, geometry, calculus, complex analysis, cryptography, meta-mathematics, combinatorics, and many more fields. This was by far the most meaningful contribution he has ever made. It is said that on the night of the seventh day, god celebrated to the fullest, as he believed he had finished his grand design. However, on the morning following the frenzied evening, he had realized that he had forgotten something. So, on the eighth day, he created trigonometry, the study of trigons, or triangles as called by stupid millennials, in a drunken mess. This angered many people and is overall considered to be a bad move. In fact, it is said that manâ€™s original sin, sin, originated from the 8th day.

\subsection{Graph C}

Graph C is $y=\cos(x)$.
Cosine is one of the fundamental trigonometric functions that takes an angle and outputs a ratio.
In this function, it appears that the function has a period of ${6.28}$, which approximates ${2\pi}$.
This is the period of $y=\cos(x)$.
A periodic function repeats itself after each period, $2\pi$, which seems to be evident on this graph.
The maximum and the minimum of this graph are respectively $y={1}$, $y={-1}$, which is a property of a cosine.
Although Sine shares this property as well, the main difference is when in the cycle when this happens; in Cosine, the high happens at the start and the end of its period, and the low at the middle of the period.

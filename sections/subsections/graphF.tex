\subsection{Graph F}

Graph F is ${y=\arctan(x)}$.
Arctangent or Inverse Tangent takes a ratio and returns an angle in Quadrant I and IV and is the inverse function of ${y=\tan(x)}$.
The original function must be restricted as ${y=\tan(x)}$ is not an one-to-one function and therefore fails the horizontal line test.
The domain must be restricted to the length of one period, pi, as that retains all the outputs of the graph.
There are an infinite amount of ways that this can be done; however, the best choice is ${x \in {({-\pi/2}, {\pi/2})}}$.
This is because the function is continuous on this domain, avoiding the asymptotes that happen on every odd integer multiple of ${\frac{\pi}{2}}$, and is the closest domain on the y-axis.
Inverse functions swap the domain and range with the original function.
The domain and range of the restricted ${y=\tan(x)}$ are ${x \in {({-\pi/2}, {\pi/2})}}$ and ${y \in \R}$, while those are the range and domain of the inverse function respectively.
Since arctangent gives an angle, it is reasonable that the function outputs an angle between ${({-\pi/2}, {\pi/2})}$, as adding a period will give an equivalent ratio along the circle.

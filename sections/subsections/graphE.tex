\subsection{Graph E}

Graph E is $y=\sec(x)$.
Secant is defined as the reciprocal of cosine ($\frac{1}{\cos(x)}$) and takes an angle as an input and outputs a ratio.
Since ${\cos(n{\frac{\pi}{2}})=0}$ for ${n \text{is odd}, n\in \Z}$, at those points, ${sec(n{\frac{\pi}{2}}) {\in \emptyset}}$.
Therefore, the function is asymptotic at those points, which is evident on this graph.
The period of this graph appears to be ${6.28}$, which approximates ${2\pi}$.
This is the period of cosine and therefore secant.
The function has two distinct branches, one which approaches positive infinity while the other approaches negative infinity on both sides of the graph.
This is heavily represented by this graph.

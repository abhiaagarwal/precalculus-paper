\subsection{Graph E}

Graph E is $y=\sec(x)$.
Secant is defined as the reciprocal of cosine ($\frac{1}{\cos(x)}$) and takes an angle as an input and outputs a ratio.
Since $\cos(n{\frac{\pi}{2}})=0$ for ${n \ is \  odd, n\in \Z}$, at those points, $sec(n{\frac{\pi}{2}}) {\in \emptyset}$.
Therefore, the function is asymptomatic at those points, which is evident on this graph.
The period of this graph appears to be ${6.28}$, which approximates ${2\pi}$.
This is the period of cosine and therefore secant.
The function has two distinct branches, one which approaches positive infinity while the other approaches negative infinity.

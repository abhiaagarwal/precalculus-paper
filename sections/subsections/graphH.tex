\subsection{Graph H}

Graph H is $y=\tan(x)$.
Tangent is defined as the ratio of Sine and Cosine, and takes an angle and outputs a ratio.
The function appears to have a period of $3.14$, which is approximately $\pi$, a property of the function.
Since the function is defined as $\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}$, and ${\cos(n{\frac{\pi}{2}})=0}$ for ${\text{n is odd}, n\in \Z}$, tangent is undefined at all those values.
As such, it is asymptomatic at $x={n{\frac{\pi}{2}}}$, which is evident on this graph.
${\sin(n\pi)=0}$ for ${n \in \Z}$, meaning that ${\tan(n{\pi})=0}$, so the x-intercepts of Tangent are all integer multiples of ${\pi}$.
This is reflected on this graph.

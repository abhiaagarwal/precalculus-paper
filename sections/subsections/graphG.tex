\subsection{Graph G}

Graph G is $y=\sin(x)$.
Sine is one of the fundamental trigonometric functions, and takes an angle as an input and outputs a ratio.
This function appears to have a period of ${6.28}$, which is approximately ${2\pi}$, a property of Sine.
A periodic function function has a domain of all real numbers, which is evident on this graph.
The maxima and minima of this graph are $y=1$, $y={-1}$ respectively.
Although Cosine also shares this property, Sine is unique as it starts at 0, has its maximum $\frac{1}{4}$ths of a cycle in, its minimum $\frac{3}{4}$ths of a cycle in, and ends at $0$.
